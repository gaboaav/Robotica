    "The poles of a sphere are singularities of representation, and the existence of singularities is a result of the fact that a sphere does not have the same topology as a plane. The location of these sigularities has nothing to do with the sphere itself. Singularities of the parametrization are particularly problematic when representing velocities as the time rate of change of coordinates, since these representations may tend to infinity near singularities even if the point on the sphere is moving at a constant speed '$\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2}$'. There are 2 ways to overcome the problem:"

An implicit representation views the n-dimensional space as embeded in a Euclidean space of more than 'n' dimensions, such as a 2D unit sphere can be viewed as a surface embedded in a 3D Euclidean space. An implicit representation uses the coordinates of the higher-dimensional space, but subjects these coordinates to constraints that reduce the number of DOF</li>"
