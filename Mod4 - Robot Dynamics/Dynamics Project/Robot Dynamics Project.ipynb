The motion should be simulated with at least 100 integration steps per second.  Your program should calculate and record the robot joint angles at each step. This data should be saved as a .csv file, where each row has six numbers separated by commas. This .csv file is suitable for animation with the CoppeliaSim UR5 csv animation scene."
